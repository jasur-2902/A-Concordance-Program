# A-Concordance-Program
A concordance is a table that tells how often a word appears in a text (or where in a text it appears; but we are not using this definition).

Basic program for a concordance that:

1) Reads a text
2) Separates it into words (any collection of letters appearing between non-alphabetic characters)
3) Places them into a table (if they are not already there with an initial count of 1)
4) Or adds one to its count in the table (if it's already there).
